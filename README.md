# EyeSee (Horrible Name ;-;)
EyeSee is a website made for blind people. It has two major features: 
1. Allowing users to interact with a speaking chatbot (Hard coded because we ran out of time so very little functionality) 
2. Identify and interact with objects in the world around them using machine learning

We made sure that every single element of our website is fully accessible to people with visual disabilities.
